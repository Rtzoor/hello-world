Hi GitHub :)

I first experienced programming during my studies for an Electricity and
electronics engineering degree in an "Intro to computers and Assembler
language" course in 2017.Since then I also completed "Switching and Digital
Systems" course and "Intro to computer science and C programming" course.
In my time studying i also completed courses in math, physics and others such
as calculus, linear algebra, mechanics, electricity, chemistry, micro-economics
and the history of science.

Currently my focus lies in developing web applications, which mainly involve
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, as well as some other technologies.
